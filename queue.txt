Notes about things that I want to know about


- DOS - Disk Operating System

- Apple DOS - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_DOS
	- OS for the apple 2 from 1978 - 1983
	- It was superseded by the ProDOS in 1983
	- Has three major releases
		- DOS 3.1 DOS 3.2 DOS 3.3
	- Prior to the release of DOS 3.1, Apply users had to rely on audio cassette tapes for data storage and retrieval

- ProDOS - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_ProDOS
	- The original ProDOS was renamed to ProDOS 8
		- This is because it ran on the 8-bit apple II computer
	- It became the most popular DOS for the apple II 10 months after its release in 1983
	- ProDOS 16 came out to support 16-bit computers, but was replaced by GS/OS within 2 years of release

- Apple GS/OS - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_GS/OS
	- An OS developed by apply computer for its apple 2 GS personal computer
	- I provided facilities for accessing file systems, controlling IO devices, loading and running program files, and a system allowing programs to handle interrupts and signals
	- It uses ProDOS as its primary filing system

- Apple Computer - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.
	- Apple Inc. is an americal multinational corporation and tech company incorporated and headquartered in Cupertino, California, in Silicon Valley.
	- It was incorporated by Steve Wozniak and Steve Jobs in 1977; as of 2023, Apple is the largest tech company by revenue

	- The company was founded to produce and market Wozniak's Apple 1 personal computer. Its second computer, the apple 2, became a best seller as one of the first mass-produced microcomputers.
	- Apple introduced the Lisa in 1983 and the Macintosh in 1984, as some of the first computers to use a graphical user interface and a mouse 
	- Due to internal problems, Jobs left apple in 1985 and formed neXT, Inc and Wozniak left to pursue other ventures.
	- John Sculley served as long-time CEO for a decade
	- Apple lost considerable market share in the 90s and was weeks away from bankruptcy
	- In 1997 Apple bought neXT Inc and Steve Jobs came back as CEO for apple
	- Jobs was able to recover considerable market share with the release of the i-series of products
		- iPod, iMac, iPhone, iTunes

- MS-DOS - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MS-DOS
	- Microsoft Disk Operating System - Microsoft DOS
	- An operating system for x86 based personal computers mostly developed by microsofto

- x86 Based Personal Computers - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86
	- Also known as 80x86 or the 8086 family
	- A family of complex instruction set computer (CISC) instruction set architectures
	- Initially developed by Intel based on the 8086 microprocessor and its 8-bit-externa but variant the 8088
	- The 8086 was introduced in 1978 as a fully 16-bit extension of 8-bit Intel's 8080 microprocessor, with memory segmentation as a solution for addressing more memory than can be covered by a plain 16-bit address
	- The term x86 came into being because of the series of microprocessors that followed were all made with names that ended in 86
		- 80186 - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_80186
		- 80286 - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_80286
		- 80386 - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I386
		- 80486 - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I486

- x86 vs x64 - https://phoenixnap.com/kb/x64-vs-x86
	- x86 and x64 refer to the two most widely usd types of instruction set architectures (ISA) created by intel and amd. An ISA specifies the behavior of machine code and defines how the software controls the CPU
	- ISA is the hardware and software interface, defining what the CPU can do and how
	- The number of bits a processor is designed to process determine how much information the CPU can process per cycle. For example, a 32-bit CPU transfers up to 32 bits of data per clock cycle
	- The limitations for x86 are is in it's ability to only handle a maximum memory of 4096MB of RAM
	- Since the total number of supported cobnations is 2^32 (4294,967,295), the 32-bit processor has 4.29 billion memory locations. Each location stores one byte of data. 

	What is x64 Architecture?
	- x64 (short for x86-64)
	- It is an instruction set based on the x86 architecture that was built to handle 64 bit code.
	- It can operate in 64 bit mode or compatibility mode that supports 16 and 32 bit processes
	- x64 can handle much more memory than the x86 and additionally it has a greater number of regiter stores, 16
	- It can handle up to 16 billion gigabytes of memory, 16 Exobytes
	- It allows the CPU to process 64-bits of data per clock cycle

- CP/m - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CP/M
	- Originally stood for Control Program/Monitor
	- Later changed to Control program for microcomputers
	- Created in 1974 for the Intal 8080/85 based microcomuters
	- It is a DOS - Disk Operating System
	- It was eventually displaces by DOS following the 1981 introduction of the IBM PC

- S-100 Bus - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S-100_bus
	- Alrair bus, IEEE 696-1983
	- The s-100 bus was an expansion bus that allowed consumers to expand their computers with additional Expansion cards
	- This provided the basis for modularity when building a computer, either at home or in the office

- Computer Bus - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus_(computing)
	- A communication system that transfers data internally within a computer or between computers
	- In most computers there is an internal bus known as the system bus that connects the cpu and memory

- Expansion Bus - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expansion_cardhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expansion_card
	- We will refer to the expansion card in this definition and reference the expansion bus within it
	- An expansion card is a printed circuit board that expands functionality of a computer
	- It can be a nic (network interface card), Graphics card, Hard drive adapter card, raid card, etc
	- The expansion bus is the row of slots that these expansion cards plug into

- UNIX - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix
	- A family of multitasking, multi-user computer operating systemsthat derive from the original AT&T Unix, whose development started in 1969 at the Bell Labs research center by Ken Thompson, Dennis Ritchie, and others
	- It was intended only to be used internally within Bell Labs, but AT&T Licensed Unix in the late 70s
	- There were many Unix variants
		- BSD           - University of California, Berkeley
		- Xenix         - Microsoft
		- SunOS/Solaris - Sun Microsystems
		- HP-UX         - HP/HPE
		- AIX           - IBM
	- AT&T sold the rights to Unix in the early 90s to Novell and then it was sold to The Open Group
	- The Open Group allows the use of the mark for certified operating systems that comply with the Single UNIX Specification (SUS)

- Additional UNIX Resources

		- This is an awesome reference to lots of information on unix and unix based operating systems
